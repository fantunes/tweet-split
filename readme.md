# How to run

It's vital to have node.js installed in your stack. There aren't any other dependencies (to keep this as simple and sweet as possible). If you don't have node, please [install](https://nodejs.org/).

1. Open your console/terminal
1. Run `node tweet-split` (this is using a sample file to generate the tweets)
1. You can also run your own sample text, just passing an argument which *always need to be the filename*:
    `node tweet-split your-own-sample.txt`
